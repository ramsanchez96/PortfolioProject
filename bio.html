            <h3 class="aboutMe">About me:</h3>
            <p>I'm a born and raised Charlotte, NC native. I graduated from Weddington High School in 2014. After grdauating
                I began volunteering full-time while still wokring part-time to gain technology skills in a professional
                environment. </p>
            <p>I began my professional career at Blueline Technologies as a front end developer and designer for CMS based websites.
                During my time there I became proficent in WordPress, HTML, and CSS.</p>
            <p>After a year at Blueline Technologies my volunteer work took me to New York where I volunteered full-time as
                support for those in the field providing releif work in areas suffering from natural disasters.</p>
            <p>Before moving back to North Carolina after my time in New York I spent a summer in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I
                helped english speaking African immigrants adjust to thier new homes and translate their immigration papers.
                My favortie thing about that experience was seeing first-hand how all people want the same things out of
                life.</p>
