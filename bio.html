                <h3>About me:</h3>
                <p>I'm a born and raised Charlotte, NC native. I graduated from Weddington High School in 2014. After grdauating I began volunteering full-time while still wokring part-time to gain technology skills in a professional environment. </p>
                <p>I began my professional career at Blueline Technologies as a front end develperand designer for CMS based websites. During my time there I became proficent in WordPress, HTML, and CSS.</p>
                <p>After a year at Blueline Technologies my volunteer work took me to New York where I volunteered full-time as support for those in the field providng releif work in areas suffering from natural disasters.</p>
                <p>Before moving back to North Carolina after my time in New York I spent a summer in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I helped english speaking African immigrants adjust to thier new homes and translating their immigration papers. My favortie thing about that experience was seeing first-hand how all people really want are the same.</p>
